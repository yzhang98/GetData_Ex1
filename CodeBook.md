This is the submission of the Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data course, offered by Jeff Leek in Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.
The assignment is to collect, work with, and clean the HAR (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones)  Data Set, on UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data set originally is published by:  
Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013. 

## Variables, Data, and Transformations
The variables in this data set including those columns extracted from the original training and test data sets. Only the mean and standard deviation of each measurements are included. Two additional columns are added, activityName and subject, to identify the activity name and the subject performed the activity. Each row in the data set is an average of each measurement, aggregated by the acivity and the subject.

## List of Variables
The variables in the final data set (MeasurementAverageByActivityAndSubject.txt) including:
* activityName
